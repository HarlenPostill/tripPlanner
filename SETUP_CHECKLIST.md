# Setup Checklist - Complete These Steps in Order

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST DO - Xcode Configuration

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Configure App Groups (5 minutes)

**For tripPlanner target:**
1. [ ] Open Xcode project
2. [ ] Select **tripPlanner** target in project navigator
3. [ ] Click **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. [ ] Click **+ Capability** button (top left)
5. [ ] Select **App Groups** from the list
6. [ ] Click **+** in the App Groups section
7. [ ] Enter: `group.com.hrln.tripPlanner`
8. [ ] Ensure the checkbox next to it is **checked**

**For BusTrackerWidgetExtension target:**
9. [ ] Select **BusTrackerWidgetExtension** target
10. [ ] Click **Signing & Capabilities** tab
11. [ ] Click **+ Capability** button
12. [ ] Select **App Groups**
13. [ ] Click **+** in the App Groups section
14. [ ] Enter: `group.com.hrln.tripPlanner` (must match exactly!)
15. [ ] Ensure checkbox is **checked**

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Add Location Permissions to Main App (3 minutes)

**Option A - Using Xcode UI (Recommended):**
1. [ ] Select **tripPlanner** target
2. [ ] Click **Info** tab
3. [ ] Click **+** button to add new row
4. [ ] Select: `Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description`
5. [ ] Set value: `This app uses your location to find the nearest transport stops and show real-time departure information.`
6. [ ] Click **+** to add another row
7. [ ] Select: `Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description`
8. [ ] Set value: `This app uses your location to keep widgets updated with the nearest transport stop departures.`

**Option B - Edit Info.plist directly (if you have one):**
1. [ ] Find Info.plist in tripPlanner folder
2. [ ] Open it
3. [ ] Add the XML keys shown in `INFO_PLIST_SETUP.md`

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify File Target Membership (5 minutes)

**Check these files are in tripPlanner target:**
1. [ ] Models/TransportStop.swift
2. [ ] Managers/LocationManager.swift
3. [ ] Managers/StopsManager.swift
4. [ ] Views/StopsListView.swift
5. [ ] Views/AddStopView.swift
6. [ ] Views/StopDetailView.swift
7. [ ] Views/MapPickerView.swift
8. [ ] NewContentView.swift
9. [ ] tripPlannerApp.swift

**Check these files are in BusTrackerWidgetExtension target:**
10. [ ] SharedModels.swift
11. [ ] BusTrackerWidget.swift (should already be there)
12. [ ] AppIntent.swift (should already be there)

**How to check:**
- Click on each file in Project Navigator
- Open File Inspector (right panel, or Cmd+Option+1)
- Look at "Target Membership" section
- Check the appropriate target box

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Update App Entry Point (2 minutes)

Choose one option:

**Option A - Use new file:**
1. [ ] Delete or comment out the `@main` struct in ContentView.swift (if it has one)
2. [ ] The new `tripPlannerApp.swift` file will be your app entry point
3. [ ] Make sure it's in the tripPlanner target

**Option B - Update existing file:**
1. [ ] Find your current `@main struct` (likely in ContentView.swift or similar)
2. [ ] Replace its `body` to use `NewContentView()` instead of `ContentView()`

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Build & Verify (2 minutes)

1. [ ] Select a physical device or simulator
2. [ ] Build the **tripPlanner** scheme (Cmd+B)
3. [ ] Check for any build errors
4. [ ] Fix missing imports or target membership issues
5. [ ] Build the **BusTrackerWidgetExtension** scheme
6. [ ] Verify both build successfully

## üìù Notes

**If something doesn't work:**
1. Check `COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` for troubleshooting
2. Verify App Group identifiers match exactly
3. Rebuild both targets
4. Check Xcode console for error messages
5. Ensure all files are in correct targets

**Common Issues:**
- Build error ‚Üí Check file target membership
- No location permission ‚Üí Check Info.plist keys
- Widget not updating ‚Üí Check App Group configuration
- Can't add stops ‚Üí Check network connection and API key

**Getting Help:**
- Review code comments in source files
- Check `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for architecture
- See `INFO_PLIST_SETUP.md` for detailed Xcode steps
